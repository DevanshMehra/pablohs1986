ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm a developer and audiovisual producer.

I learned to code in 2019 when I started my studies on development. I'm confortable using Java, SQL, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 and GIT, although I'm always digging deep and learning new things. 

ðŸ”­ I'm currently learning JDBC, Swing, JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Python and will start soon with Android Studio.

Here you can take a look at my projects and drop me a line with the contact form if you wish.
